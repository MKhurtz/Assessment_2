			<h2 class="section-heading">Interview with a IT professional</h2>
			<p>Before starting this company, we researched extensively on what working in IT involves. We canvased widely and interviewed many IT professionals. Below is the results of a recent interview conducted by one of our team (Peter Goodwin) with a IT professional:</p>
			<p><strong>Name:</strong> Michael M<sup>c</sup>Coy<p/>
			<p><strong>Role:</strong> Manager (ICT &amp; Marketing)</p>
			<p><strong>Interview date:</strong> 08/04/2019</p>
			<br>
<ul>

	<li><strong>1. Why did Michael decide to take on a career in IT?</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>I decided to start my career in IT, which was network engineering, because of my love for technology. To be honest, it was all the IT guys in my high school that helped me decide where I wanted to go with my IT career. It was years later, with the help of some colleagues in the Federal Government, that changed my thinking and head into the cybersecurity industry.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li><strong>2. What has been the biggest change in his role/the industry over the last 5 years? (Mobile-friendly?)</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Technology is always changing and the biggest change for me is probably the cloud technology that is available now. Adding to that, it could also be all the devices that are now available and now has been developed and used in the real world, such as the Internet of things (IOT).</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li><strong>3. What sort of problems do you encounter day-to-day and how do you fix them?</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The biggest thing about the position now is leadership and trying to produce the best effort from my team. Secondly, looking after all the computers and network within the organisation, and making sure everyone has the resources to their job to the best of their abilities.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li><strong>4. What advice can you give to someone looking to get into the same field as you? Languages to learn, programs, etc?</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>At the moment, in today's environment, I would not recommend the network engineering environment unless you want to work for companies that provide cloud services. My recommendation in the programming languages would be to learn Swift, PHP, JavaScript, Java and Python or go into an area within the cybersecurity industry.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li><strong>5. What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>IT professionals operate in many different roles, such as cyber security, networking, software development but are, and must, work in a collaborative environment because they must work together to make sure that all areas are covered.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li><strong>6. What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>It really depends on what your job title is and what kind of industry you are working in. Secondly, the size of your company also has an impact on how much contact you have with different types of people.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li><strong>7. Where does an IT professional spend most of their time?</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>It really depends on what your job title is and what kind of industry you are working in. Secondly, the size of your company also has an impact on how much contact you have with different types of people.</li>
		<li>Most of the time IT professionals are sitting behind a computer. Unless they are working on server rooms or helping connect computers up. This is why chairs and posture are so important.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li><strong>8. What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Leadership is the most challenging aspect but is also rewarding when you see the projects that your team have worked on. This is challenging because you want to give your team the resources, time and rewards so they develop and also know they are doing a good job.</li>
	</ul>
